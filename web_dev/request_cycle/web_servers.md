<!-- design philosophies of Linux-->
<ul>
	<li>Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things.</li>
	<li>An operating system, by its nature, embodies the philosophy of its creators... The creators of the Unix operating system started with a radical concept: they assumed that the user of their operating system would be computer literate from the start. The entire Unix philosophy revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing.</li>
	<li>Treat all users with respect.</li>
</ul>

<!-- what is a VPS?-->
<ul>
	<li>To have a website on the internet, we need to have our website files on a web server, so we need a VPS (Virtual Private Server), where we can rent a space on a web server.</li>
</ul>

<!-- what are the advantages of VPS? -->
<ul>
	<li>Privacy: As you don't share your OS with anyone else, there are no other websites on your server that potentially have access to your files.</li>
	<li>Customiztion: With a VPS Server, you have your own Operating System. This also means that you have your own instances of all server applications such as Apache, PHP, and MySQL. If you need to have any of these services customized, you can make changes to suit the server to your needs.</li>
	<li>Control: If you're installing server applications that require a system restart, you can do so at any time. Even though technically you share a server with other VPS servers, your VPS server can be restarted without affecting anyone else.</li>
	<li>Dedicated Resources: On a VPS Server, you have dedicated amounts of RAM available to you at any time. Unlike shared hosting, there is no one else on your server that can use utilize all the RAM when you need it most!</li>
</ul>

<!--Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?-->
