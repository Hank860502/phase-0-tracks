# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?
 
*Version vonctrol is a kind of note, and it can helps programmer to remember why he or she wrote the code and let the reader understand what is happening there.
*Branch is a useful way to create new stuff but not to interferce the master and it is easier to find out where the error comes from.
*Commit is a way to make changes and a good commit message should be detailed and clear about what changes we have made.
*Merge conflict means there are two files that have changes those are too similar that git cannot resolve them or bring them into a same file.
